## About Me

Hi!👋 My name is Ronie Martinez. I am a Python and C/C++ enthusiast working on open-source projects on my free time⌛ since 2013📅. I am currently working as a Python Software Specialist here in the Philippines🇵🇭.

My first open-source project is [libqpsd](https://github.com/roniemartinez/libqpsd)📸, a PSD (Photoshop Document) & PSB (Photoshop Big) Plugin for Qt/C++ (Qt4/Qt5). After **libqpsd**'s success, I started writing other libraries for Qt/C++. 

When I was introduced to the Python programming language, I started to love it 💖 and made several open-source projects. You can find all my projects on [Github](https://github.com/roniemartinez?tab=repositories&type=source)

I started writing✍️ blogs about [Python](https://www.python.org) programming  in order to share my  knowledge and experience developing various applications.

## My Projects

### FreeSearch 💬

FreeSearch is a messaging chatbot🤖 for web searching. I wrote this chatbot🤖 as a [response](https://ron.sh/search-the-web-for-free-using-messenger-and-python/) to the original creator's somewhat too expensive 💵 [GoGetFunding](https://gogetfunding.com/lets-keep-the-free-web-search-facebook-messenger-chatbot-running/). Still, hat's off 🎩 to him and his idea💡!

This solves the problem that most mobile📱 users here in the Philippines🇵🇭, particularly students, cannot afford or does not have access to the internet. Luckily, there is [Internet.Org](https://internet.org) which provides free access to Facebook and Messenger. This is because these domains are [zero-rated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating) on most mobile carriers🗼 around the world🌏. To read more about FreeSearch visit [FreeSearch.me](https://freesearch.me). To use in action visit [FreeSearch Facebook page](https://m.me/freesearch.me) or look for 🔍 "FreeSearch" on Messenger.
